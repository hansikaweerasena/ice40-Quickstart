# iCE40 Quickstart

This repository is dedicated to helping FPGA enthusiasts and beginners explore the capabilities of the iCE40 FPGA. It contains a collection of basic programs designed to get you started with digital design. Inside, you'll find:

- **Blinky**: A simple LED blinking program to demonstrate basic FPGA outputs. [View Blinky Code](https://github.com/yourusername/iCE40-FPGA-Essentials/blob/main/Blinky)
- **Knight Rider**: An LED pattern inspired by the famous moving light sequence, showcasing more complex LED control. [View Knight Rider Code](https://github.com/yourusername/iCE40-FPGA-Essentials/blob/main/KnightRider)
- **UART Communication**: A module for sending and receiving messages using UART protocol, interfaced through Python, to demonstrate basic serial communication. [View UART Code](https://github.com/yourusername/iCE40-FPGA-Essentials/blob/main/UART)

Each program comes with comprehensive documentation, including step-by-step guides on how to set up your development environment, compile the code, and deploy it to an iCE40 FPGA board. Whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or just curious about FPGAs, this repository has the necessary tools to get you started.

This repository will use Alchitry Cu FPGA which can use open-source toolchain that includes Yosys, Nextpnr, and IceStorm tools, which are commonly used for Lattice iCE40 FPGAs.
